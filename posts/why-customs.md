## Begining

In November 2019, I made a mistake by quitting the start-up that I enjoyed working for. I especially liked our team. I left it for a company that is closer to my house. It was also full of many experienced developers who I was hoping that I can sit next to and get mentored from. I was wrong. The company culture and my team was not what I was expecting. I have not made any friends for a long time, even my immediate team. I had to learn new frameworks, languages and get used to the existing code base. It was really horrible from the start. I was thinking of quiting, but by the time I decided, the pandemic happened. I thought If I am not going to commute any more I will have a lot more free time in my hands, so I can use that to create a personal project to help people.

## The Idea Source

I wanted to create something that was low maintenance and it would help generate some income too. While doing research software as a service (SaaS), I came across this talk about [Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business by Jason Cohen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw). It gave me a good idea about what I need to look out for when finding a problem to solve. Main things are that it should be B2B, recurring need, user should be autonomous at using this. So with this in mind I started googling.

As a European citizen in UK I realise that the BREXIT may affect me. So I decided to research how will it affect Great Britain. The main idea I came across was that the most of UK's trade is done with Europe, after BREXIT this trade will be more expensive and will be subject to delays.

Doing more research in this problem, I realise it is the customs that will be the most painful part of the Brexit for businesses. At this time I realised that the government is giving grants to prepare for BREXIT customs problem. By seting up a company with in tention to declare customs, I managed to get a grant for a certification in customs.

## Why did I set up a company before having any customers?

My intention has always been, not to set up a business if I don't have to. The grant I applied for required me to do so through a company. So this was my first reason. My second reason was HMRC only collabrates with businesses who want to be a software provider not individuals. So with out a business I couldnt even get access to documentations or API end points.

So I set up a business. The most challenging part was to come up with a name.

### The name for the business

It is called Agile Import ltd. How did I come up with it? At the time I knew that I could have made this software for every business that trades with the UK. But I had to select a small subsection of those businesses. I selected Importers in the UK first because there are more of them compared to exporters, and second because my research showed interruptions for UK importers could meant shortages of goods and that could make all of their prices hike up. So I selected Import as the second word in the name.

For the first word in the name, I was thinking for days and researching what it should be. I knew it should be an adjective that represents my and business values. I found a few influential lists of UK customs software providers in the UK (Like on the government site), and they were all sorted alphabetically. Seeing this I thought the business should start with a word at the beginning of the dictionary, so it would be listed on the top part of the list. I opened the dictionary, and went through every word, wrote down the potential names. When I got to the word Agile I felt something tell me this was it. It resonated in me. I do want to create a business that adapts to changes and be agile. The agile working methodology has been something drilled intomy brain since university and internship. SO I chose this.

## Seting up the business

March 14th, the UK has started to mention lockdown. I was in london at the time to go to company house to set up the business. But because of the potential of catching covid, I went home and set the business up at home, online.

Then I have done my interviews at the HMRC to get access to the new customds declaration servcice documnetation and access to API's.

I applied to open a business bank account for the training grant, but this took almost 3 months to set up an business bank accaount. It took me about 5 months to complete the certification. At the same time I was working full time, I was networking with customs proffesionals, reading HMRC custroms docs and writing the code for the software. My biggest motivator around this time was how much I wasn't happy at my day job, and the more effort I put in this customs project after work, the quicker I will be happy again.
