The first time I came across this type of styling in HTML classes was with **Bootstrap**, around 4 years ago. I enjoyed it because it enabled me to get consistent styling across my website.
It also enabled me to have my HTML elements look like they have been designed by a  proffesional, rather than using the default HTML look.

Then I started using with **Material UI with React**. This had styled elemnts in the form of components. These components came with many features that I may have to manually implement. So it has been a time saver in terms of decelopment.
However Material UI coming with many features with each component mean that, my website may become quite large overtime, even if you dont use all the features in coponents. This will cause slower load times and reduced visitor satisfaction.

Since summer I have been using **Tachyons** for a personal project. It has atomic utility classes that can be combined to achieve same outcomes as normal CSS. I particularly like their typography and font sizes. 
One of the mistakes I have done using Tachyons was that having many elements/pages have the same classes, when I could have just wrote them once on top level. This would have also made it easie to make the app Dark mode by just changing the top level classes.

Lately I stumbeld upon **Tailwind CSS** on hacker news. The first time I came across Tailwind was with Tailwind UI. It came across really bad at first because I thought "Why would anyone pay for these pre made components?". Second time I came across Tailwind was when tailwind CSS 2.0 was released. I am a sucker for bright colours and a cool trailer. I realised it is just like Tachyosn but it has way more classes, more beginner friendly support and more configurable.

I have been using Tailwind CSS for a couple of days, and I really enjoyed the experience. Especially having all the videos on youtube that help you make the most auto of it.

It looks like I will use Tailwind CSS in all of my future websites, because of how big the community using it is, I will be able to progress faster with it.
