Today I signed an employment contract with an amazing company called Perlego. I will start in February as a mid-level javascript developer. Getting to this stage hasn't been easy. in the past 3-4 months, I have spoken to around 10 companies, completed around 5 tech tests and received 3 offers from different companies.

## The Right Way, Which Didn't Work

Almost all companies need to employ a software developer and because there are so many companies, how do you know which ones to apply to? Before I was a graduate, I wanted to work for the well known big brands. I had a huge list of company names. Briefly looking at their careers site reduced the list as because either there wasn't a vacancy for my role or because it was different than how I imagined it to be.

Then I gave them a ranking for how much effort will it take complete the application form. This included:

1. Research the company (on the news, social media and on their marketing site) and take notes.
2. Become genuinely passionate about the company, their values mission and goals.
3. Modify the CV to include only the most relevant things to the role and the company using my notes.
4. Create a cover letter for this specific role and the company using my notes.
5. Draft answers to all the questions in their application site.
6. Get someone to proofread all of that and apply recommendations.

This above process took me minimum 3 days to complete, average a week.

After all that effort only a small portion of my applications got back to me. They were all rejections. I felt like going around in circles and I didn't want to apply for any more jobs. Mainly because when I research them and start liking them I get no response.

## The Not So Right Way, Which Worked Much Better

This method involves the least effort and most return.

### Preparation

1. Make sure you have a CV with all the relevant things to what you wanna work on.
2. Sign up to Indeed. Add all your relevant information on your profile.
3. In the find jobs page type in the language you want to work on and location. If you are not sure about the location, type the UK and select remote in the next page.
4. Set all the filters on your search results.

Now you got a lot of potential jobs, its time to apply.

I like to clear out that list in one sitting, because if you come back the next day, you may end up re-reading the jobs that you previously didn't want to apply. The most efficient way to apply to these jobs is as follows:

### Applying

1. Open every role one by one because titles may be misleading or incorrect. When it says frontend or backend in the title, the description can be full-stack.
2. Scroll to "required skills" to make sure you have them before you read the rest of the job post
3. If the application button says "apply on company site" then you may want to add this to your favourites and get back to it later. Because these will almost always require you to fill out a form. By the time you finish applying to this job, you could have applied to 5 jobs with "apply with indeed button". Most of the jobs on Indeed are from recruitment companies. So when you apply for a role "on company site", you are actually signing up to that recruitment companies site. In the end, you can just go through your favourites and apply to all the relevant jobs on the recruiter's site.
4. If the application button says "apply with Indeed", then go ahead and read the responsibilities and then the job/company brief.
5. If you like it, click apply and on to the next one. If you accidentally try to re-apply to a job then indeed will warn you of that.
6. Take notes of any questions from the job description that you may have, so when they contact you, you will have specific questions to ask. This is a good time to do this as you have been reading a lot of job descriptions and you may say "Ah! if this job had this duty or benefit like this other one it would be awesome! I better ask when they call."

> Note: Some times applying to too many roles from the same recruitment agency can blacklist you as a spammer, so if you suspiciously never heard back from them, just reach out.

Watch how next day you start getting so many emails and phone calls to discuss the roles that you applied for. Not all of them are going to contact you, and not all recruiters are going to contact you for the exact job that you applied for but another one with similar qualities.

You can repeat these steps on similar job sites like CW jobs or linked in. If you have exhausted all your searches, wait 1 or 2 weeks and repeat the above steps. there will be more jobs.

When you are on the phone with the recruiter, it is important to get some of the facts right in the beginning to make sure you are not wasting anyone's time.
The recruiter will have a lot to say about the job because they want you to go fo the job, but if the role isn't what you are looking for then there isn't any point listening to his pitch. To optimise this I ask these questions.

### Talking to the recruiter

1. Before they call you to write down all the things that are important to you in your next job. I.e. Need more support or freedom. Remote? Salary? Company size? We can talk about preparing this list in more depth in another blog.
2. Ask them if the company they are representing satisfies the above list.
3. If you haven't already remembered which role they are calling you for just ask them to remind you because you applied to many roles last night.
4. If you got any specific questions regarding the role then ask now.
5. Give the stage to the recruiter to pitch you the company, while he or she does that, you should:
   1. Put them on speaker or headphones so your hands are free
   2. Have a notepad and pen ready, dedicate at least a page for each potential role otherwise, it will become a huge mess.
   3. Company name is the title, recruiters name next to it to save his or her number
   4. Write down as much of the information as possible. Especially the bits that you don't remember seeing on the job description. These will be useful for the interview, and when you are making a decision.
   5. You will have some questions. If you are quick enough write them down or ask the recruiter to pause while you write that down to not miss any valuable information.
6. Then they will ask you a few questions. Don't lie, be honest so you don't waste any one's time. If you don't want to commute to their office to be upfront.
