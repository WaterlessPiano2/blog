Reading and spending a lot of time on an area does not make you an expert. I learned this the hard way. I spent a lot of time studying networking and writing code, and it always felt like I was not progressing at all. 
There is a Turkish saying. 'Zararin neresinden donersen kardir'. The sooner I stopped working on this, the less I'll be wasting time. Always spending my free time on something and not getting anywhere was mentally challenging to sustain for a long time.

I tried to list the main reasons I stopped working on this business idea.

## The complexity of customs

I have never worked in this field, and I am no expert. I studied and earned a qualification about it. I read a ton of online resources, blogs and HMRC's online documentation to learn about customs. Reading was my only way to learn.

As I was not putting most of the knowledge I earned to work, it felt demotivating and challenging to remember.

## Restarting work 

I have around five different repositories that have been started and not finished customs declaration software because I always find something new, and it would throw a spanner in the works. One of the reasons to create a new project is that it was a complicated/unfinished problem last time I left the code. When I am back after a long time, it takes me a long time to understand what I was doing. By the time I do, the time allocated for the project that day would be up. 

When I decided to start a new repo, I used a customs doc as a map for my product, but then it turned out that the document was out of date. Found another document, and it had significant changes, making it difficult for me to adapt my software.

## My current job

When I started working on customs, I didn't like my job; I would get stuck on a problem for a few days and not get any help. I got a new job about a year after, and I really like it. I can do so much in the day I am exhausted when I am finished. 

I used to have such a bad time at work; I would get motivated to work more after wards to have a chance of a better future. Now I am already in a pretty good place; I can't think to be in a better workplace than I already am. 

## Lack of demand

I spoke to 100's of people who may want to work with me on creating a customs product, but I haven't found anyone to dedicate themselves to it. I needed someone to fill the customs knowledge gap but couldn't find them. If there is no one to buy or partner up with me, why would I even build this?

## More exciting things to learn

With the amount of reading and coding I have done for this Business, I could have studied and learned many more other interesting things, created projects etc., but I got stuck in this. I felt like missing out.
